# Library Management System

## Overview
This is a simple command-line-based Library Management System written in C language. It allows you to manage a library's book records, including adding new books, deleting existing books, searching for books by ISBN, book name, or author name, updating book information, and issuing books to borrowers.

## Project Description
Mr. Ben is a librarian in a school and managing books manually. Now he wants to have a computerized system, so he hired you for the development of a new library management system for him. You are required to make a menu-driven Library Management System with a file-based database in C language. The use of pointers and a structural approach is a must. Records (All the data) should be read/written using file handling techniques.

## Features
- Add new book records to the library.
- Delete book records by ISBN, book name, or author name.
- Search for books by ISBN, book name, or author name.
- Update book information including serial number, ISBN, book name, edition, author, and reservation status.
- Display all book records in the library.
- Issue books to borrowers, with reservation status tracking.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
```bash
gcc library.c -o library
```
3. Run the program.
```bash
./library
```

## Usage
- When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu of options to choose from.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various library management tasks.
- You can add, delete, search, modify, display, and issue books as needed.

## File Structure
- `library.c`: The main source code file.
- `library.txt`: The data file that stores the library's book records.
- `temp.txt`: A temporary file used for file operations.
